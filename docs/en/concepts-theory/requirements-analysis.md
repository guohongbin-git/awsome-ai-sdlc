Progress in large-scale language model-assisted software development requirements analysis process
1. Introduction
Requirements analysis (RA) plays a vital role in the software development life cycle (SDLC). It is directly related to the success of the project and can effectively reduce the risk of project failure.1. Bad requirements are one of the main reasons for project failure2. However, the traditional requirements analysis process is often time-consuming, error-prone, and highly dependent on manual interpretation and analysis.4. Large Language Models (LLM), as a transformative technology, show great potential to revolutionize many aspects of software engineering, including requirements analysis.6. In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in LLM, and its rapid development has also profoundly affected natural language processing (NLP) and interdisciplinary application fields.13. The number of LLM-related research publications has grown exponentially in recent years.13. The effectiveness of requirements analysis is the key to the success of software projects, and the rapid development of LLM technology has brought significant opportunities for innovation and improvement in this field.
This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current progress in using LLM to assist in the software development requirements analysis process. The report will cover the evolving role of LLM in requirements engineering, its application in requirements elicitation, analysis, specification and modeling, optimization techniques, challenges faced, hybrid methods, relevant tools, case studies, impact on requirements quality, latest research trends and future directions.
2. The evolving role of large-scale language models in requirements engineering
LLM’s pre-trained understanding of natural language enables it to be effectively adapted to specific requirements engineering tasks.15. LLM has the potential to fundamentally improve the requirements engineering process by automating historically time-consuming and error-prone tasks such as requirements elicitation and specification.7. LLM, with its natural language processing capabilities, has become an active partner in requirements engineering, providing automated support for requirements elicitation, specification generation, quality assurance, and many other aspects of requirements7. LLM brings both generative and analytical capabilities to requirements engineering7. This suggests that LLM is transforming from a passive tool to an active collaborator in the requirements engineering process, enabling higher levels of automation and the potential to augment human expertise.
In requirements engineering, LLM can be divided into the following categories:
Generative pre-training Transformer (GPT): Models including ChatGPT and GPT-3 have been widely used in requirements engineering. These models help generate requirements documents, system code, and test cases, thereby facilitating the automation of repetitive tasks and accelerating documentation workflows7. For example, ChatGPT has been used to generate initial drafts of requirements specifications and even code snippets that were subsequently refined by human engineers7. GPT models also support progressive hinting technology to iteratively improve the relevance and specificity of generated outputs7。
Code-focused language models (such as Codex): Specifically designed for programming related tasks. In requirements engineering, Codex is often used to directly translate natural language requirements into executable code, thus bridging the gap between high-level requirements and specific technical implementations.7. Codex also plays a key role in test case generation, helping to validate requirements by automatically creating test scripts based on initial requirement inputs7。
Bidirectional encoder representation (BERT) and its variants: These models are context-aware and offer significant advantages in analyzing textual requirements7. They support requirements engineering by performing tasks such as requirements classification, conflict detection, and keyword extraction7。
Transformer-based models (such as T5, Llama 2): Extending the Transformer architecture to tasks such as paraphrasing and summarizing requirements is critical to translating technical language into terms that are more easily understood by different stakeholders7. These models are also able to summarize large amounts of requirements documents7。
Multimodal model: Can work with both textual and visual data, especially for requirements engineering tasks involving diagrams or visual aids, such as user interface sketches and workflow diagrams12. Achieve comprehensive understanding and documentation by combining visual assets with text-based requirements12。
Different architectures of LLM provide specialized functionality that can be used for different tasks in the requirements engineering process, thus requiring a strategic approach to model selection based on the specific needs of the activity. LLM is being effectively integrated into different stages of requirements engineering, including requirements elicitation, modeling and verification, thereby improving accuracy and efficiency7。
3. Application of LLM in requirements elicitation and analysis
LLM has demonstrated strong auxiliary capabilities in demand acquisition. They can help identify missing information and provide feedback on the feasibility and clarity of requirements7. LLM can also convert user stories into structured requirements and facilitate interactive acquisition by analyzing stakeholder input7. With an AI-powered conversational system, LLM is able to ask relevant questions and guide stakeholders to provide more detailed information, improving the feedback and idea gathering process17. Additionally, AI tools can generate questionnaires or lists of interview questions faster and more comprehensively17. LLM can serve as a collaborative brainstorming partner, stimulating innovative insights and mining market intelligence by analyzing complex text and performing market analysis.17. They can also summarize key points from a variety of sources into clearly formatted reports17. For iterative product development, AI can come up with additional ideas based on historical usage and event analysis17. AI tools can also speed up the final stages of requirements elicitation by quickly building rough prototypes17. LLM can generate an initial draft of requirements specifications based on natural language prompts7. This suggests that LLM is enhancing traditional requirements elicitation techniques, potentially reducing reliance on manual labor and accelerating the initial stages of requirements gathering by providing automated information extraction, idea generation, and preliminary documentation capabilities.
In terms of demand analysis, LLM also shows great potential. They can be used for requirements classification, conflict detection and keyword extraction7. LLM also helps identify and correct poorly defined requirements1, and utilize LLM and hint patterns to detect missing requirements and minimize the requirements set1. Research shows that LLM’s ability to elicit requirements is comparable to that of human experts18, the requirements generated by LLM were evaluated as more consistent with the participants’ initial ideas and potentially more complete18. LLM can analyze end-user feedback, classify requirements and identify dependencies19. They may also be used for automated quality assurance, risk identification, conflict negotiation, and impact analysis of requirements changes19. LLM can also serve as an alternative source for annotating datasets for machine learning experiments.19. Research comparing the performance of LLM with other artificial intelligence techniques such as SVM and LSTM in requirements classification has also been carried out19. Additionally, LLM can analyze non-functional requirements to resolve existing conflicts among non-technical stakeholders19. This demonstrates that LLM exhibits significant potential to automate and enhance various aspects of requirements analysis, including classification, conflict detection, and quality assessment, often outperforming or complementing traditional AI methods.
One study compared the performance of LLMs with human experts in requirements elicitation and found that LLMs had significant advantages in both the speed (720 times) and cost (only 0.06% of the cost of human experts) in generating requirements.18. Participants believed that the requirements generated by LLM were more consistent with their ideas, but they tended to believe that the solutions that were more consistent with their ideas were created by human experts.18. LLM-generated documents also show more complete trends18. While LLM offers significant advantages in terms of speed and cost of requirements elicitation, the perception of alignment and the nuances of human understanding still highlight the irreplaceable role of human experts in the process.

4. Application of LLM in requirements specification and modeling
LLM excels at generating requirements documents. They help generate requirements documents, system code and test cases7. ChatGPT has been used to generate an initial draft of the requirements specification7. Research shows that LLM can achieve the output quality of junior software engineers in generating software requirements specifications (SRS).9, and can provide complete and consistent SRS document drafts, thereby significantly reducing the development time of junior engineers9. LLM is also able to identify and correct issues in a given requirements document, with GPT-4 showing a strong ability in providing constructive feedback9. In addition, LLM can generate well-structured requirements documents in a very short time20. This demonstrates that LLM is capable of significantly accelerating the creation process of software requirements documents, by generating initial drafts and even identifying potential issues, freeing up human experts to focus on more complex and nuanced aspects.
In addition to textual requirements, LLM also helps in creating system models. They can assist in generating UML diagrams7, convert high-level requirements into formal specifications7, supports the generation and verification of specifications7, and provide visualization of requirements through model specification7. Natural language processing tools can facilitate the creation of conceptual models from textual requirements, such as UML diagrams and feature models21. This demonstrates that LLM is not limited to textual requirements but can also facilitate the creation of visual models and formal specifications, thereby improving the clarity and precision of documented requirements.
LLM also plays a role in generating formal specifications. They can translate natural language specifications into formal code or domain-specific languages ​​(DSLs)7, check the correctness of syntax and semantics7, and assist in debugging and fixing protocols7. The SpecGen project focuses on automatically generating formal program specifications using large language models.22. This shows that LLM can bridge the gap between natural language requirements and formal specifications or code, potentially enabling a more rigorous verification process.

5. LLM optimization technology in requirements engineering
Fine-tuning techniques are critical to align the output of LLM with the requirements of requirements engineering. Parameter-efficient methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and hint tuning have proven to be very effective7, capable of handling complex specifications with greater relevance and accuracy7. For more complex tasks, full fine-tuning is used7. Fine-tuning LLM using domain-specific data can improve its performance7. This shows that fine-tuning LLM using techniques such as LoRA and hint tuning can adapt it to the specific nuances and criteria of requirements engineering, thereby improving the quality and relevance of the generated output without requiring extensive retraining.
Cue engineering skills are also crucial. Few-shot and iterative prompts are important techniques for building structured inputs for LLM that can produce responses that meet requirements engineering standards.7. Techniques such as few-shot prompts, iterative prompts, and contextual prompts are critical to guide LLM's response and improve the output quality of requirements engineering tasks7. Tip engineering is the art of producing inputs that yield the most accurate and relevant output from LLM24. This shows that the way prompts are designed and used significantly affects the effectiveness of LLM in requirements engineering, and that techniques such as few-shot and iterative prompts are critical to achieving desired results.
6. Challenges and limitations faced by LLM in demand analysis
Although LLM has made significant progress, it still faces some challenges and limitations in the field of requirements analysis. LLMs may have difficulty understanding domain-specific language nuances7, and there is a phenomenon of "hallucination" that produces seemingly reasonable but untrue information.6. They may also have difficulty understanding complex dependencies in various requirements engineering environments7. Additionally, there are issues with the quality and completeness of the output generated by LLM7, and there are technical and procedural limitations in handling structured input, leading to inconsistencies and errors in the output7. There are also specific difficulties in coding and testing tasks related to requirements7, and building effective cues for complex RE tasks can be challenging7. LLM may also perpetuate or even amplify biases present in the training data.6. Using sensitive data as a prompt for LLM also presents security and privacy risks, including potential data breaches6. LLMs may sometimes be unable to complete tasks that are simple for humans, making their behavior unpredictable27. The output of LLM often requires review and validation by human experts10. This shows that despite the progress made in LLM, there are still significant challenges in requirements analysis, especially in dealing with the complexity of real-world software projects, thus requiring careful consideration of their limitations and the need to develop mitigation strategies.
7. Hybrid methods and human-machine collaboration
To improve the reliability and accuracy of output generated by LLM, hybrid approaches that combine LLM with traditional requirements engineering tools are emerging.7. At the same time, human-machine collaboration systems that emphasize manual evaluation and integrate LLM output are becoming increasingly important.7. One proposed model is to use LLM as a "first draft agent", generating initial drafts that are then verified and refined by human experts18. Researchers call for a shift in focus from hype to leveraging the community's analytical skills and understanding of technical complexities, and taking a human-centered perspective on how to conduct requirements engineering for LLM10. Because LLM processes large amounts of text, it can discover connections that humans might miss and provide a unique perspective.10. It takes time for users to adapt to AI assistance and understand the non-deterministic nature of LLM responses3. While LLM can help, there is no substitute for human involvement in formulating requirements, and its output must be carefully scrutinized and validated by human stakeholders.23. This suggests that the most effective integration of LLM in requirements analysis may involve a collaborative approach in which the LLM handles automatable and potentially tedious tasks, while human experts provide critical domain knowledge, critical thinking, and validation to ensure the quality and accuracy of requirements.
8. Integrate LLM’s requirements management tools and platforms
An increasing number of professional tools and mature platforms are integrating LLM capabilities to simplify and enhance all aspects of requirements management. These tools offer a range of capabilities from automated generation to quality analysis and integration with existing workflows30。

9. Case studies and practical applications
Case studies on the use of LLM in requirements analysis and related tasks demonstrate its diverse applications and tangible benefits in saving time, reducing costs, and improving quality and efficiency. For example, a case study of generating an SRS for a university student club management portal showed that an LLM could produce as complete and consistent a draft as a junior engineer.9. The AI ​​Decomposition (AiD) tool developed by First Line Software leverages the OpenAI API to decompose requirements into user stories and acceptance criteria, saving time and cost39. Case study of using AI for requirements analysis in a complex domain (using HaivenTM) shows the potential to improve quality, speed and team effectiveness, and highlights the importance of context3. A leading IT consulting firm implemented an AI chatbot to conduct preliminary customer interviews, reducing manual workload and accelerating project launch dates40. ArgonDigital’s AI can analyze documents, code or user interfaces to extract detailed requirements, even when documentation is incomplete8. gpt-engineer is an open source project that allows LLM to analyze high-level requirements and build software, including a case study of creating a multiplayer snake game23. LLM-Assisted Socioeconomic Background Analysis in Medical Admissions use case demonstrates LLM’s ability to extract and analyze specific types of information from text41. Financial services firm uses custom LLM to significantly reduce mapping time of cybersecurity regulations to policies and controls42. Implementing a generative AI knowledge base for claims adjusters can speed up processing and improve customer experience42. Use LLM to identify common customer complaints and valuable features, enabling data-driven product development and marketing decisions42. Semiconductor company uses LLM to ingest knowledge base articles and provide customized responses, thereby improving customer service efficiency42. Real-time code suggestions from GitHub Copilot increase developer productivity42. Training a small LLM to detect obfuscation in the command line could improve cybersecurity42. Expand customer service capabilities and improve customer satisfaction using LLM trained on company data42。
10. The impact of LLM on software requirements quality
LLM has the potential to improve requirements specification accuracy and reduce ambiguity7. AI-driven tools can help create clear, comprehensive and testable requirements44. AI tools can analyze requirements to detect inconsistencies and suggest ways to improve them20. LLM can help detect the quality of written requirements and analyze them against various writing standards such as the 6C principles of good communication2. Using AI for requirements analysis may lead to better “definition of done” for user stories3, and fewer missed requirements will be discovered during testing3. The output quality of LLM in generating SRS documents can be comparable to that of a junior software engineer9. However, LLM can create hallucinations that lead to unclear or incorrect instructions in software development.6. The quality of LLM output is highly dependent on the quality and bias of the training data6. Assessing the quality of LLM output is critical because there is not always a single right answer, and humans may not be able to identify superhuman output10. While LLM can speed up work, it can also lead to more errors early in a project if not managed properly.10. This demonstrates that LLMs have the potential to significantly improve the quality of software requirements by improving clarity, completeness, and consistency, but their reliance on training data and the risk of hallucinations require careful validation and human supervision to ensure accuracy and prevent potential errors.
11. Latest research trends and future directions
Current research is actively addressing the limitations of LLM in requirements analysis and exploring new avenues for its integration, focusing on improving assessment, adjustment, prompting, and promoting effective human-machine collaboration. Future research needs to continue to develop more effective metrics to evaluate the performance of LLM in RE tasks.7, further improving the tuning of LLM using data specific to different software development domains7, explore and refine prompt engineering methods to better guide LLM to complete RE tasks7, and further research into hybrid methods that combine LLM with traditional RE tools and methods7. Additionally, challenges related to the reliability and consistency of LLM in the RE process need to be addressed.7, developing a human-machine task delegation framework45, and validate LLM in a real-world-like environment45. Research also needs to address barriers to organizational adoption of LLM45, and shift the focus to how to effectively utilize the capabilities of LLM for requirements engineering10, explore the application of LLM in requirements prioritization in agile methods46, develop LLM customized for specific RE tasks23, and address ethical issues in LLM to ensure responsible use of artificial intelligence24。
12. Conclusion
At present, significant progress has been made in using LLM for requirements analysis, which shows great potential in key aspects such as requirement acquisition, analysis, specification and modeling. LLM is expected to revolutionize the requirements engineering process by automating tasks, improving accuracy, and enhancing efficiency, thereby shortening development cycles and improving software quality. However, we must also realize that LLMs are not perfect, and they still face challenges in handling domain-specific languages, understanding complex dependencies, and avoiding "illusions". Therefore, the effective implementation of future software development requirements analysis will rely on a hybrid approach that combines the automation capabilities of LLM with the domain knowledge and critical thinking of human experts. Ongoing research is essential to refine evaluation metrics, optimize model tuning, improve hint engineering, and address ethical considerations. By proactively addressing challenges and promoting human-machine collaboration, we can fully unleash the potential of LLM in the field of software development and move towards a more efficient and higher-quality software delivery future.
