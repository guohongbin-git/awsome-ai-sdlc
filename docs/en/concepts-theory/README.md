# Concepts and Theories

## AI in Software Development

AI technologies are revolutionizing every stage of software development. From requirements analysis to design, implementation, testing, and maintenance, AI provides intelligent assistance to improve development efficiency and quality.

## AI-assisted Software Development Lifecycle

AI enhances the entire SDLC process, including:
- Requirements analysis: NLP techniques help understand user needs
- System design: AI algorithms optimize architecture
- Implementation: Code generation and auto-completion
- Testing: Intelligent test case generation
- Operations: Anomaly detection and predictive maintenance

## Machine Learning for Software Development

Applications of ML in software development include:
- Code defect detection
- Performance optimization
- Code style checking
- Development efficiency prediction

## Generative AI and LLMs in SDLC

Generative AI and LLMs are reshaping software development:
- Automated requirements documentation
- Intelligent code snippet generation
- Automated test case creation
- Documentation translation and localization
